   <p id="text"> My favorite hobby is playing with my dog. My dog's name is Simba, he is a 1 year old husky. Playing with Simba is my favorite thing to do because I can tell him ANYTHING. I reamber a time we I was sick, Simba saw me through the window that I was not feeling well, and then he stared barking, my brother was at his soccer game with my Dad and my Mom. My Nina was the only adult in the house, but she was scared of the dog, so I went outside to check on him. I played with him, then after 30 mins of me just talking to him about my life I stated to feel better :) AND I WILL NEVER FORGET THAT TIME. <br>
 <h1>I love you Simba!! <br> üòò üê∫</h1> </p>
